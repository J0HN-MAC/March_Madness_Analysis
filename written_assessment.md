## Self-Assessment

I worked on this project individually, instead of bein on a team. There are some advantages to working solo. The cumulitive process is much clearer without a team. I aslso learned more material by having to create every step of the process.  But it was also more time-consuming and I didn't have support from peers when I needed help.

For me, the main lessons I learned were about time management. During the same time frame as the bootcamp, I also learned to touch type. My wife works for the military and has been in training for the last year. This involved two cross-country moves, living in a hotel room, and lots of exhausting travel for the holidays. But we also made the most of our time by seeing lots of sites across California and New York. A good work/life balance is also important. I had plenty of excuses to not to do well on this project, but I stayed focused and positive and was able to be successful. 

## Project and Team Summary

I undertook this project individually but I used several team components. I Established a repository with multiple branches. Multiple commits were made to each branch and then later merged to the main branch. There was some confusion with the initial datasets, but I was able to proceed with a viable project. I would advise a new cohort to allow plenty of time for the initial exploration of new datasets so if problems arise, a new dataset can be chosen.

Using a dataset for NCAA men's basketball that compiled KenPom power rantings, I explored the age-old saying that "defense wins championships". I was able to find a strong correlation between the KenPom defensive power rating and tournament wins using Tableau Public Visualizations. This correlation was stronger than the other metrics used. When using a logistic regression machine learning model, I did not find sufficient evidence that defense had an increased impact on results, thus could not reject the null hypothesis.
