## Self-Assessment

Working individually instead of a team
advantages: clear output and process, helps to be familiar with all the material covered to have a better knowledge of and confidence with the different topics
disadvantages: takes more time, less peer support, less group/community experience

For me, the main lessons were about time management. During the same time frame as the bootcamp, I also learned to touch type. My wife works for the military and has been in training for the last year. This involved two cross-country moves, living in a hotel room, and lots of exhausting travel for the holidays. But we also made the most of our time by seeing lots of sites across California and New York. A good work/life balance is also important.

## Project and Team Summary

I undertook this project individually but I used several team components. I Established a repository with multiple branches. Multiple commits were made to each branch and then later merged to the main branch. There was some confusion with the initial datasets, but I was able to proceed with a viable project. I would advise a new cohort to allow plenty of time for the initial exploration of new datasets so if problems arise, a new dataset can be chosen.

Using a dataset for NCAA men's basketball that compiled KenPom power rantings, I explored the age-old saying that "defense wins championships". I was able to find a strong correlation between the KenPom defensive power rating and tournament wins using Tableau Public Visualizations. This correlation was stronger than the other metrics used. When using a logistic regression machine learning model, I did not find sufficient evidence that defense had an increased impact on results, thus could not reject the null hypothesis.
